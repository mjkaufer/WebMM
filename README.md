This is a basic manipulator that can do inverse kinematics to find your mouse position!!!

You can either move your mouse on the screen and have the manipulator follow your cursor, or toggle the functionality with the button in the top left, and have the manipulator move to your last mouse click.

## TODO

* Clean up UI
* Interface to change hyperparams
    * Num joints
    * Joint length
    * Movement speed
* Optimize movement
    * Determine ideal angle delta, then do something like only move one angle at a time
